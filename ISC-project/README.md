joe: it's mainly a architechure pattern (5min)
roughly explain how our app works based on mvc:

model - change to "return null"
tab1: abdul jatin : login (2min)

##What went good and bad (4min)
  - unit test provide : dont need to run the whole
  - version control git : [git] 1 function - commit - 1 function, because if they are related, you are screwed : show commits in git
  - spring mvc good: show picture 
  - spring mvc bad: over-engineering, use too many frameworks 
  - deviation: email excellentUI search / coding conventious : naming style, less 40 lines.
  - find the balance of things, use the most suitable tech

##Lessons learnt & conclusions (3min)

Abdul thinking:

  - don't be too ambitious :  : don't over enge
  - make big problem into small problems : and if small problem is still too hard for you, keep until they can be anwsered by yes/no
  - communication : stuck somewhere for days, then I search for help, but after I explained what happend

Thank you very much for your patient. free ask (all time about: 21 mins)
