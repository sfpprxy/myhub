Customer visits the home page and selects a food category. Customer browses foods within the selected category page, then adds a food to his or her shopping cart. Customer continues shopping and selects a different category. Customer adds several foods from this category to shopping cart. Customer selects 'view cart' option and updates quantities for cart foods in the cart page. Customer verifies shopping cart contents with summary cost and proceeds to checkout. In the checkout page, customer checks the total cost, fills in personal data (e.g. credit card details), then submits his or her details. The order is processed and customer is taken to a order confirmation page. The confirmation page provides a unique reference number for tracking the customer order, as well as a summary of the order.
